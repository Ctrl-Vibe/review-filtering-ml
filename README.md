# Project overview

This project was aimed at building a supervised ML pipeline through fine-tuning of a pretrained Transformer (DistilBERT) to classify Google location reviews into policy-driven categories (e.g., relevant, spam, ad, irrelevant, rant/no-visit).

# Setup instructions

You donâ€™t need to set up anything locally. To reproduce the results or use the pre-trained model, simply open the Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab through the steps below:

1. Click on the `filtering_reviews_model.ipynb` file in the repository.
2. Click on the **'Open on Colab'** button that appears at the top of the file.
3. Follow the instructions listed in the file.
